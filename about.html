          I don’t teach cyber or AI because I love machines. I do it because I keep meeting
          everyday people who feel quietly left behind by a digital world that moves faster
          than their confidence.

          <p>
            I did not step into cyber security because I love machines.
            I stepped in because I kept watching ordinary people — parents, students,
            small business owners — quietly fall behind a digital world that moves
            faster than their confidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my work as a lecturer and PhD researcher, the same sentence keeps coming up:
            <em>“I feel exposed, but I do not even know what I should be worried about.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I saw people trying their best — using phones, apps, AI tools and social media —
            but still feeling like there was a secret rule book they never got to read.
            That feeling of “everyone else seems to know what they are doing” can be very lonely.
          </p>

          <h2>Turning complexity into calm</h2>
          <p>
            My work sits in the middle of a few worlds: academic research, teaching,
            cyber security, user experience and AI. I translate what is happening in those
            worlds into:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple language that makes sense in everyday life.</li>
            <li>Tools that help you see your own patterns and risks.</li>
            <li>Services and coaching that give you a human partner, not just another app.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What this space is for</h2>
          <p>
            This site is a small, calm corner of the internet where you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Look at your digital footprint without shame or panic.</li>
            <li>Understand how AI and online systems affect you and your family.</li>
            <li>Get practical, human help if you want someone to walk through it with you.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="muted" style="font-size:0.8rem; margin-top:0.75rem;">
            If you would like to talk, you can always start with a short message on the
            <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. You do not have to have the right words —
            you just have to say, “This is what is on my mind.”
